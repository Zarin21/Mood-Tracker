## Project Description
**Mood Tracker** is a personal mental health journal app that allows users to track, visualize, and share their moods over time. Users can log emotional states, see trends in their mood history, view friends’ moods, and explore mood events on a map. The app emphasizes privacy while also allowing social interaction and support among friends.

## Key Features

- **Mood Logging and Tracking**: Users can quickly log their mood, add notes, and specify the location and context of their emotions.
- **Interactive Maps**: Personal and friends’ mood maps show mood events with location markers. Users can filter by distance or specific friends.
- **Mood History**: Chronological list of mood entries, with filtering options by mood type, week, or keyword.
- **Profile Management**: Users can manage their profile, change usernames or passwords, and customize avatars.
- **Friend System**: Users can follow friends, view their mood histories, and comment on mood events.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for friend requests and mood activity updates.
- **Input/Edit Mood Fragment**: A flexible input screen for adding, editing, or deleting mood entries with dropdowns for emotional states.
