## Project Part 3 Feedback

### Code Base

All features are complete and the code is well organized. Validation is present, but could be seperated out from onClick methods to be more reusable.

### Documentation

Some documentation is present, but not all classes have descriptions about what the file does, and the MoodEvent model is missing proper Javadocs.

### Test Cases

Minimal unit tests are present. Make sure that each user story has a UI test, and you should test logic like validation in your unit tests. The current unit tests that check if a user is added a list is testing functionality that is not part of your code, and as such is not needed.

### Object Oriented Design

Cardinalities are missing from the diagram. All fragments should have a relationship with an activity.

### Backlog

Backlog is clear and up to date.

### Sprint Planning and Review

Sprint plans could use a bit more detail, and the layout could be improved. It is hard to tell what comparison between what was assigned the last week and what was completed. Please link to the issues you were assigned last week, indicate which were completed, what you will work on this week, and a justification for what wasn't finished and any other notes/comments needed about what was done. It is probably easiest to use a table.

### Demo 

Demo was smooth and all features worked.

### Tool Use

Please make sure I can understand what the PR is about based on the description, and to have people approve the PR before merging.

### General Feedback

All features were completed, but more tests and documentation for the code is needed, as well as additional clarification on sprint plans and PRs.
